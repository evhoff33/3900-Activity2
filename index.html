			<p> Hi there! I'm Evan Hoffschneider and I'm currently attending the <u>University of Nebraska Omaha</u> where I am majoring in <b>Computer Science</b> with a minor in MIS. I'm in my junior year and I'm currently working at a part time IT internship for the company Scoular. Some things I like to do in my free time are going to the gym, playing and watching basketball, playing video games on my PC or Xbox, listening to music, and trying new food. I have done a lot of travelling since I've been in college and exploring different cities and parts of the world is one of my most favorite things to experience! I especially love Chinese and Thai food and my favorite animals are cats although I unfortunately don't own one right now. I have been putting a lot of time and effort into learning more hands on and practical skills relating to software engineering and development, so I'm very excited to learn Django this semester and add another tool to my belt! Below are some of my favorite pictures from travelling in the last 2 years: </p>
