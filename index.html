			<p> Hi there! I'm Evan Hoffschneider and I'm currently attending the University of Nebraska Omaha where I am majoring in computer science with a minor in MIS. I'm in my junior year and I'm currently working at a part time IT internship for the company Scoular. Some things I like to do are going to the gym, playing and watching basketball, playing video games on my PC or Xbox, listening to music, trying new food. I have done a lot of travelling since I've been in college and exploring different cities and parts of the world is one of my most favorite things to experience! I especially love Chinese and Thai food and my favorite animals are cats although I unfortunately don't own one right now. </p>
